JULIE'S README NOTES

Time took: 10 hrs
Didn't finish/improvements:

- allowing a user to upload an img from their device (I did img urls). I was reading up on blobs and Multer but didn't time to do more. If I could improve this project, I'd definitely do that first.
- implementing react-router-dom: there were lots of changes since I last used it a year ago, so I decided not to use it since I was already unfamiliar with other things. Structure of this app without routes is definitely not the best.
- loading, error, success states - just didn't have time to implement
- more details to design/layout
- accessibility - barely added any. Would've liked to do more

This is a project made with

frontend

- create-react-app
- React
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- MaterialUI
- HTML
- RESTful APIs

backend

- Express (Node.js)
- JavaScript
- RESTful APIs

To run this project, awkwardly have two windows: one cd'ed into the react-app folder, and another cd'ed into the server folder.

For the React application, npm i, then npm start. For the Express app, npm i, then nodemon index.ts. The entire application should be working!

A user can
-see full list of images
-add an image
-edit an image
-delete an image
-search images by name

Note: backend might be iffy. This is is my first time writing REST APIs.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
